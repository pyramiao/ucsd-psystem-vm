The project now uses GNU Autoconf to configure.
The tarball compiles \[lq]out of the box\[rq].
Pre-built Debian packages are available on the web site.

All of the commands consistently use \f[I]getopt_long\fP(3) for argument
parsing.  All commands now come with a man page.

.SS Version 0.5 (2001-Aug-02)
Long integer support has been added.
.SS Version 0.4 (2001-Jun-08)
This time, protability has been improved.
Disk access now functions even when \f[I]mmap\fP(2) is not available,
using \f[I]lseek\fP(2), \f[I]read\fP(2) and \f[I]write\fP(2) instread.

The code to implement the Turtle Graphics (and all dependencies on X11)
has been moved to a separate process.  This should make porting to
other platforms much easier, because this is simply a dedicated server
that reads turtle commands.  (For historical reasons, it is called at
the moment but still \f[I]ucsdpsys_xturtleserver\fP(1), his background,
he can not even hide it completely).
.PP
The PRINTER: Device is now also implemented,
otherwise faulty are a few P-commands have been corrected.

Anyone who had a problem with the F(iler the eX(amine command crashing,
should try again now.
.SS Version 0.3 (2001-May-20)
The build instructions have been simplified.
The Apple Pascal 1.1 demo now runs.
.SS Version 0.2 (2001-May-10)
Things have improved.
I now have Apple Pascal 1.3 and 1.1 version working.
Running is perhaps slightly exaggerated,
but at least the compiler seems to work.
.SS Version 0.1 (2000-Sep-21)
Many years ago I learned programming at school using Apple-Pascal.
From nostalgic feelings out (and because it was the best Pascal system,
the more I could use), I've started to code interpreter for a p-Machine.
Actually, not yet ripe for a publication, but in a discussion
in de.alt.folklore.computer was considerable interest expressed in this
software.

Although this program is the status of best-Alpha, it's here to download
ready.  Documentation non-existent, unfortunately.
Use the source, Luke! Use the source, Luke!
