There is now \[lq]glue\[rq] support for the APPLESTU and TRANSCEN units,
found in the ucsd-psystem-os project's \f[CW]host/klebsch\fP source
directory.

.\" Change 20, 21
Some byte-sex issues have been fixed, in anticipation of
trying to debug the cross compiler's big-endian support.
The virtual machine now takes the system's byte sex from the
byte sex of the first disk.  All subsequest disk images are check
to be sure they are all the same.

.if t \(bu
.\" Change 16
The \f[CW]SYSCOM^.MISCINFO\fP word is now emulated, and sets the various
bits that the emulator has control of, including the
word-machine and byte-sex indicators.

Some more detail about ucsd-psystem-os has been added to the
\f[I]ucsdpsys_vm\fP(1) man page.

.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 17
The \f[CW]syscom^.sysunit\fP field is now set to the unit that the
\f[CW]SYSTEM.PASCAL\fP file was found on, rather than always setting it to 4.

.if t \(bu
.\" Change 15
When using a terminal emulator such as \f[I]xterm\fP(1) or
\f[I]gnome-terminal\fP(1), the \f[I]ucsdpsys_vm\fP(1) command is now able to
track the actual terminal size, and adjust \f[CW]CRTINFO.WIDTH\fP and
\f[CW]CRTINFO.HEIGHT\fP at run-time, so that they always reflect the
actual terminal size.  This is implemented using a SIGWINCH
interrupt handler, and the \f[I]ncurses\fP(3) support for SIGWINCH; see
\f[I]resizeterm\fP(3) for more information.

.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 12
The system date (in the system's segment 0 procedure 1 stack frame,
local variable 67) is now adjusted at run-time, to ensure that the
system's idea of the current date is always correct, and the resulting
date stamps on disk files will be correct (well, as correct as a
two digit year will ever be).
